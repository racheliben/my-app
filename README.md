Hello,

My name is Rachel.

I created a React application, in which a table of users is loaded,
When you click on a user, the list of his posts opens,each user has the option to add additional posts,
And there is an option to filter users by name or email when you type a search word in the search field.
I built the project in a responsive way, and I also created a customized display for mobile.
I handled the recurring errors from the server, and updated the user when there was a malfunction.
I added a loading component, which is displayed while loading the data.
I used mui to design the project,
I built the project in a clear and maintainable way,
And I used advanced benefits of React.

Hope you enjoy my work.
